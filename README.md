Background
----------

##Preface to okiwi / slack version##
This CoC was cloned to allow modifications for situations other than physical events, notablely for user forums (with Slack being the current favorite). As such, all references to domain names (codeofconduct.com for example), are no longer relevant. If you have a suggestion to improve this fork, please open an issue. 

##Original Version of Background##

I've put this project under Left Logic to try to disown it from an individual. Actually, what I'd like is some kind of community organisation that projects like this can move to (perhaps also moving [mit-license.org](https://github.com/remy/mit-license) to it - but one step at a time eh?).

This simple site offers up the code of conduct that (I believe) Tiffany Conroy first wrote up for jsconf.eu 2012. I reused the same content (removing the jsconf.eu specific parts) for Full Frontal 2012.

I'd like to continue using this as a simple go to reference for code of conduct for ~~events~~ slacks I run - and equally ~~events~~ slacks you run.

This is *not* owned by me - this is a public resource - so if there's changes, please create a pull request, and if it makes sense, it'll be merged.

On that note - I'd rather not be the only person with merge permissions, so I hope that by the time you read this, I'm not the only person with those rights.
